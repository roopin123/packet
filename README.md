It a basic packet sniffer using Scapy in Python. It captures network packets on a specified interface (eth0 in this case),
processes each packet to extract relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses,
protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP, or other), and prints a snippet of the packet payload.
